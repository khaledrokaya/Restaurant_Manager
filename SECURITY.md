- **LinkedIn**: [Khaled Mostafa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khaled-mostafa-jr)
- **GitHub**: [@khaledrokaya](https://github.com/khaledrokaya)

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths of source file(s)** related to the manifestation of the issue
- **The location of the affected source code** (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Any special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact of the issue**, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After submitting a report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability within 5 business days.

3. **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress towards a fix and full announcement.

4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days of the initial report.

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using Restaurant Manager:

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version of the application
- **Secure Hosting**: Deploy on HTTPS-enabled servers
- **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive information to version control
- **Regular Backups**: Maintain regular backups of your data
- **Access Control**: Implement proper user access controls

### For Developers

When contributing to Restaurant Manager:

- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Authentication**: Implement secure authentication mechanisms
- **Authorization**: Ensure proper authorization checks
- **Data Protection**: Protect sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Code Review**: Conduct security-focused code reviews
- **Static Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to detect security issues

## Security Features

Restaurant Manager includes several security features:

### Client-Side Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive form validation using Angular Reactive Forms
- **XSS Protection**: Angular's built-in XSS protection mechanisms
- **Route Guards**: Protected routes requiring authentication
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking

### Data Protection

- **Local Storage**: Secure handling of local storage data
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling and cleanup
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs (when backend is implemented)

## Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

As this is a client-side only application, please note:

- **Data Storage**: Currently uses local storage (not suitable for production sensitive data)
- **Authentication**: Client-side only authentication (easily bypassed)
- **Data Validation**: Client-side validation only

### Recommendations for Production

For production deployment:

1. **Backend Integration**: Implement proper backend API with server-side validation
2. **Database Security**: Use secure database connections and proper access controls
3. **Authentication**: Implement JWT or OAuth for secure authentication
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Content Security Policy**: Implement proper CSP headers
6. **Security Headers**: Add security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment and initial triage
- **Day 3-7**: Detailed analysis and impact assessment
